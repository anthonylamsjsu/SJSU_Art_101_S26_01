	<h1><p><b>Ghost Relax Ending:</b></p></h1>
	<p>You glance over at the couch to see a small figure of what looks to be a small knight dozing off on your furniture. You reckon they are just tired and waiting out the storm so you gently lay some blankets to over them to keep them warm and go about your day relaxing.</p>
	<p>A few hours later you hear them wake up and you move over to see them stumble outside the front doors never to be seen again.</p>
