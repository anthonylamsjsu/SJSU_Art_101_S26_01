	<h1><p><b>Knight Relax Ending:</b></p></h1>
	<p>You lay down on the couch and doze off hoping to pass the time until you the storm ends.</p>
	<p>During your slumber you feel what could be described as blankets being placed on you however you are too dormant to wake up and react. </p>
	<p>After a few hours you wake up and the storm has finally passed. You don’t know who put these blankets on you and you can't see anyone else around, but at least you survived and leave the mansion intact.</p>
