	<p>The knight walks over to the various shelves that cover the room, many of them containing books of various knowledge both common and niche. They then stumble upon a rather elaborately decorated book covered in dark ink and pearly eyes and grab it from the shelf, however they quickly realize that was a grave mistake when a ghastly figure appears behind them snatching them up.</p>
	<p>Too bad the knight will never to be seen again...</p>
