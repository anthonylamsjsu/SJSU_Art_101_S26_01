                <h2>Finding the Art Building</h2>
                <p>After asking a friendly upperclassman for directions, I found myself standing in front of the Art Building—a beautiful structure with large windows that let natural light flood into the studios. The building had character, with sculptures adorning the entrance and colorful murals painted on the walls.</p>
                <p>I pushed open the heavy door and stepped inside. The hallway was lined with student artwork from previous semesters. Paintings, photographs, and mixed-media pieces covered every available wall space. I paused to admire a particularly striking abstract piece, feeling inspired already.</p>
                <p>The building had that distinct smell of turpentine, paint, and creativity—a scent I would come to love. I found the room number on my schedule: Studio 204. Taking the stairs two at a time, I felt a surge of excitement. This was really happening.</p>
