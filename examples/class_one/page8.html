                <h2>Creating My First Artwork</h2>
                <p>Back at my easel, I set up a canvas and began sketching. The pencil felt natural in my hand as I drew the outline of the SJSU campus, with the art building at the center. I wanted to capture that feeling of arrival, of beginning something new.</p>
                <p>I mixed my paints carefully—warm yellows for the morning sun, cool blues for the sky, and vibrant greens for the campus trees. As I worked, I lost track of time. The world outside the studio faded away, and it was just me, my canvas, and the creative flow.</p>
                <p>Professor Martinez came by and watched me work for a moment. "Good use of color," she said. "Don't be afraid to push those values darker in the shadows." Her feedback was encouraging and constructive. I felt like I was already growing as an artist.</p>
