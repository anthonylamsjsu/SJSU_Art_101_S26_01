                <h2>The First Studio</h2>
                <p>I claimed an easel near the large north-facing windows, where the natural light was perfect for painting. The studio itself was a work of art—high ceilings, white walls covered in years of paint splatters, and shelves filled with every art supply imaginable.</p>
                <p>I ran my fingers over the wooden easel, feeling the grooves and marks left by countless students before me. This easel had witnessed so much creativity, so many artistic journeys. I felt honored to be part of that legacy.</p>
                <p>The room had a sink in the corner for cleaning brushes, storage lockers for our supplies, and a critique wall where we'd display our work. I could already picture my paintings hanging there, receiving feedback and growing with each piece. This studio was going to be my second home.</p>
