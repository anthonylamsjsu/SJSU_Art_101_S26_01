                <h2>Exploring Materials</h2>
                <p>After the assignment introduction, Professor Martinez took us on a tour of the materials room. It was like an artist's candy store—rows of oil paints in every color imaginable, tubes of acrylics, watercolors, pastels, charcoal, and so much more.</p>
                <p>"Don't be afraid to experiment," she told us. "Some of the best art comes from trying something new, from making mistakes and learning from them." I picked up a tube of ultramarine blue paint, feeling its weight in my hand, and imagined the colors I could create.</p>
                <p>I also discovered materials I'd never worked with before—gouache, ink, and various types of paper and canvas. The possibilities were overwhelming in the best way. I grabbed a sketchbook and started making notes about techniques I wanted to try.</p>
