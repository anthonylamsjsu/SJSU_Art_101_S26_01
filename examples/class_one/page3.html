                <h2>Meeting My Classmates</h2>
                <p>I entered Studio 204 and was greeted by a room full of easels, drawing boards, and art supplies. But what really caught my attention were the people—my future classmates, each one looking as nervous and excited as I felt.</p>
                <p>A girl with vibrant purple hair introduced herself as Maya. "First day jitters?" she asked with a warm smile. I nodded, and we started chatting about our artistic backgrounds. She was into digital art and animation, while I leaned more toward traditional painting.</p>
                <p>Soon, I met Alex, who specialized in sculpture, and Jordan, a photographer. We all shared our portfolios and talked about what drew us to art. The energy in the room was incredible—everyone was passionate, creative, and eager to learn. I knew I'd found my people.</p>
