                <h2>First Assignment Introduction</h2>
                <p>Professor Martinez handed out a syllabus, and then she revealed our first assignment. "I want you to create a piece that represents your artistic journey so far," she explained. "It can be in any medium—paint, charcoal, digital, sculpture—whatever speaks to you."</p>
                <p>"The theme is 'Beginnings.' Think about what brought you here, what drives your creativity, and where you hope this journey will take you. This isn't about perfection—it's about honesty and expression."</p>
                <p>My mind immediately started racing with ideas. I could paint a sunrise over the SJSU campus, or create a mixed-media piece combining my old high school sketches with new techniques I'd learn here. The possibilities felt endless, and I couldn't wait to start creating.</p>
