                <h2>Sharing with Classmates</h2>
                <p>As the class period came to an end, Professor Martinez asked us to share what we'd started working on. One by one, we walked around the studio, looking at each other's work. Maya had created a digital sketch of abstract shapes representing her journey into art.</p>
                <p>Alex was already working with clay, shaping a small sculpture. Jordan had taken photos around campus and was editing them on a laptop. Everyone's approach was different, and that diversity was beautiful.</p>
                <p>When it was my turn, I felt nervous showing my work, but my classmates were supportive and encouraging. "I love the way you captured the light," Maya said. "The colors are so vibrant," added Jordan. Their feedback made me feel like I belonged here, like I was part of a creative community.</p>
