                <h2>Meeting the Professor</h2>
                <p>Just as the clock struck 9:00 AM, Professor Martinez entered the studio. She was a tall woman with silver-streaked hair pulled back in a bun, wearing a paint-splattered apron that told stories of countless hours in the studio.</p>
                <p>"Welcome to Studio Foundations," she said with a warm, authoritative voice. "I'm Professor Martinez, and I've been teaching here at SJSU for fifteen years. This class will challenge you, push you, and help you discover your artistic voice."</p>
                <p>She walked around the room, making eye contact with each of us. "Art isn't just about technique—it's about expression, emotion, and pushing boundaries. By the end of this semester, you'll see the world differently." Her passion was infectious, and I felt even more excited about what lay ahead.</p>
